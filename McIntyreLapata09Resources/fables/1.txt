A hungry Fox saw some fine bunches of Grapes hanging from a vine that 
was trained along a high trellis, and did his best to reach them by 
jumping as high as he could into the air. But it was all in vain, for 
they were just out of reach: so he gave up trying, and walked away 
with an air of dignity and unconcern, remarking, "I thought those 
Grapes were ripe, but I see now they are quite sour."
