A Man and his Wife had the good fortune to possess a Goose which laid 
a Golden Egg every day. Lucky though they were, they soon began to 
think they were not getting rich fast enough, and, imagining the bird 
must be made of gold inside, they decided to kill it in order to 
secure the whole store of precious metal at once. But when they cut it 
open they found it was just like any other goose. Thus, they neither 
got rich all at once, as they had hoped, nor enjoyed any longer the 
daily addition to their wealth.
