There was once a Dog who used to snap at people and bite them without 
any provocation, and who was a great nuisance to every one who came to 
his master's house. So his master fastened a bell round his neck to 
warn people of his presence. The Dog was very proud of the bell, and 
strutted about tinkling it with immense satisfaction. But an old dog 
came up to him and said, "The fewer airs you give yourself the better, 
my friend. You don't think, do you, that your bell was given you as a 
reward of merit? On the contrary, it is a badge of disgrace."
