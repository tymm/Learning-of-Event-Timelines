There was once a Charcoal-burner who lived and worked by himself. 
A Fuller, however, happened to come and settle in the same 
neighbourhood; and the Charcoal-burner, having made his acquaintance 
and finding he was an agreeable sort of fellow, asked him if he would 
come and share his house: "We shall get to know one another better 
that way," he said, "and, beside, our household expenses will be 
diminished." The Fuller thanked him, but replied, "I couldn't think 
of it, sir: why, everything I take such pains to whiten would be 
blackened in no time by your charcoal."
