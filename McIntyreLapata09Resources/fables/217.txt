A Lion fell deeply in love with the daughter of a cottager and wanted 
to marry her; but her father was unwilling to give her to so fearsome 
a husband, and yet didn't want to offend the Lion; so he hit upon the 
following expedient. He went to the Lion and said, "I think you will 
make a very good husband for my daughter: but I cannot consent to your 
union unless you let me draw your teeth and pare your nails, for my 
daughter is terribly afraid of them." The Lion was so much in love 
that he readily agreed that this should be done. When once, however, 
he was thus disarmed, the Cottager was afraid of him no longer, but 
drove him away with his club.
