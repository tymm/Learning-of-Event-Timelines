Once upon a time all the Mice met together in Council, and discussed  
the best means of securing themselves against the attacks of the cat. 
After several suggestions had been debated, a Mouse of some standing 
and experience got up and said, "I think I have hit upon a plan which 
will ensure our safety in the future, provided you approve and carry 
it out. It is that we should fasten a bell round the neck of our enemy 
the cat, which will by its tinkling warn us of her approach." This 
proposal was warmly applauded, and it had been already decided to 
adopt it, when an old Mouse got upon his feet and said, "I agree with 
you all that the plan before us is an admirable one: but may I ask who 
is going to bell the cat?"
